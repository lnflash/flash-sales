# Hybrid Program of Work Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a hybrid storage approach for the Program of Work feature that maintains offline capability while enabling admin visibility through Supabase sync.

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. Database Schema (✅ Completed)
- Created migration: `/supabase/migrations/20240803_program_of_work_tables.sql`
- Tables:
  - `program_activities` - Stores all activities with CRM entity references
  - `program_weekly_goals` - Stores weekly goals per user
  - `program_custom_activity_types` - Stores custom activity types
  - `program_sync_status` - Tracks sync status per user

### 2. Removed Submissions Concept (✅ Completed)
- Replaced all references to submissions with CRM entities (organizations, contacts, deals)
- Created `EntitySelector` component for unified entity selection
- Updated all components to use `entityName` instead of `leadName`
- Fixed all TypeScript types to align with new structure

### 3. Sync Service (✅ Completed)
- Created `ProgramSyncService` at `/src/services/program-sync.ts`
- Features:
  - Automatic sync every 5 minutes
  - Manual sync trigger
  - Offline detection and handling
  - Conflict resolution (merge strategy)
  - Status notifications

### 4. Updated Store (✅ Completed)
- Modified `useWeeklyProgramStore` to integrate with sync service
- Added:
  - `syncStatus` state
  - `triggerSync` action
  - Automatic sync after changes (debounced)
  - Sync status listener

### 5. Admin Visibility (✅ Completed)
- Updated `useAllRepsProgram` hook to fetch from Supabase
- Admins can now see all reps' Program of Work data
- Regular users only see their own data

### 6. UI Enhancements (✅ Completed)
- Created `SyncStatusIndicator` component
- Shows:
  - Online/offline status
  - Last sync time
  - Sync in progress
  - Sync errors
  - Manual sync button
- Added to Weekly Program page header

## Data Flow

1. **Local Changes**: User makes changes → Store updates → localStorage persists → Sync triggered (debounced)
2. **Sync Process**: 
   - Local data → Convert to ProgramActivity format → Bulk upsert to Supabase
   - Fetch remote changes → Merge into local storage
3. **Admin View**: Admin opens Rep Tracking → Fetches from Supabase → Shows all users' data

## Key Features

- ✅ **Offline-First**: Works without internet, syncs when connected
- ✅ **Real-time Sync**: Changes sync automatically every 5 minutes
- ✅ **Admin Visibility**: Admins can see all reps' programs
- ✅ **CRM Integration**: Activities linked to organizations, contacts, and deals
- ✅ **Conflict Resolution**: Smart merging prevents data loss
- ✅ **Status Indicators**: Clear visual feedback on sync status

## Next Steps for Testing

1. Apply the migration to your Supabase instance
2. Test offline functionality by:
   - Creating activities while offline
   - Going online and verifying sync
3. Test admin visibility:
   - Create activities as a regular user
   - Log in as admin and check Rep Tracking page
4. Test conflict resolution:
   - Make changes on two devices
   - Verify proper merging

## Migration Command

```bash
# Apply the migration to your Supabase instance
supabase db push
```

## Environment Requirements

No new environment variables needed - uses existing Supabase configuration.
