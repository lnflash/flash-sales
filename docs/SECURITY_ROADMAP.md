### 1.2 Database Schema Updates
```sql
-- Add to users table
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN pin_hash TEXT;
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN pin_set_at TIMESTAMP;
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN pin_attempts INTEGER DEFAULT 0;
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN pin_locked_until TIMESTAMP;
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN pin_recovery_token TEXT;
