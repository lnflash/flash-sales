# Intake Form Fixes Summary

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Contact Creation Logic
**Problem**: Contacts were only created if BOTH phone number AND organization ID existed
**Fix**: Changed to create contacts if ANY contact information is provided (phone, email, or name)

### 2. Database Constraints
**Problem**: Contact table requires:
- `first_name` NOT NULL
- `last_name` NOT NULL  
- `email` UNIQUE (if provided)

**Fixes**:
- Ensure last_name defaults to "Contact" if not provided
- Handle duplicate email constraint by finding existing contact first
- Retry contact creation without email if duplicate error occurs

### 3. Lead Status Not Saving
**Problem**: Form was hardcoding `lead_status` to "contacted" instead of using "new"
**Fix**: Use the correct value from `submissionData.leadStatus`

### 4. RPC Parameter Mismatch
**Problem**: The `update_deal` RPC function expected `custom_fields_param` but form was sending `metadata_param`
**Fix**: Changed to use `custom_fields_param`

### 5. Better Error Handling
**Fixes**:
- Added comprehensive logging throughout the submission flow
- Added verification after deal creation to confirm data was saved
- Prevent deal creation if contact info exists but contact creation failed
- Handle organization creation failures gracefully
- Handle RPC function errors with proper error messages

## Key Code Changes

### Contact Creation (lines 596-730)
- Create contact if ANY contact info exists (not just if org exists)
- Check for existing contact by email first
- Handle duplicate email constraint
- Retry without email if needed
- Always set last_name to avoid NULL constraint

### Deal Creation (lines 729-740)
- Added check to prevent deal creation if contact creation failed
- Better logging of what's being saved
- Proper error propagation

### Error Handling
- Throw errors instead of silently logging
- Display specific error messages to users
- Continue with deal creation even if org creation fails

## Testing

Created multiple test scripts to verify:
- `scripts/test-form-submission-fix.ts` - Tests the complete flow
- `scripts/debug-intake-form.ts` - Debugs current data state
- `scripts/check-rpc-functions.ts` - Verifies RPC functions work

All tests pass when using direct database operations, confirming the fixes should work.

## Next Steps

1. Test the form in the browser with developer console open
2. Submit a test form and check console logs
3. Verify data is saved in Supabase dashboard
4. Check that phone numbers and lead status are displayed in submissions table
