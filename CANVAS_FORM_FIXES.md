# Canvas Form Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Contact Creation Logic
**Problem**: Contacts were only created if BOTH phone number AND organization ID existed
**Fix**: Changed to create contacts if ANY contact information is provided (phone or email)

### 2. Email Field Missing
**Problem**: Canvas form didn't have an email input field
**Fix**: Added email field to:
- FormData interface
- Form UI with validation
- All state management functions

### 3. Database Fields Not Saving
**Problem**: Phone numbers, email, and lead status weren't being saved
**Fixes**:
- Enabled lead_status field (was commented out)
- Fixed contact creation to handle email duplicates
- Added retry logic for unique constraint violations
- Store additional data in custom_fields

### 4. Better Contact Handling
**Fixes**:
- Check for existing contacts by email first
- Update existing contacts instead of creating duplicates
- Handle cases where organization creation fails
- Parse owner names correctly for contact creation

### 5. Update Function Enhanced
**Fixes**:
- Create contact if it doesn't exist during update
- Update contact phone/email if provided
- Store metadata in custom_fields
