# Migration Fixes Summary

## Fixed Issues

1. **Database References**
   - Changed `lead_id UUID REFERENCES submissions(id)` to:
     - `deal_id UUID REFERENCES deals(id)`
     - `contact_id UUID REFERENCES contacts(id)`
   - Updated indexes accordingly

2. **TypeScript Types Updated**
   - `src/types/program-sync.ts`: Updated ProgramActivity interface
   - `src/types/weekly-program.ts`: Updated Activity interface
   - `src/lib/supabase-program-api.ts`: Updated conversion functions

## Remaining Issues

The codebase still has references to a "submissions" system that appears to be the old lead tracking system. The ActivityModal component is trying to link activities to "submissions" but the actual database uses deals/contacts.

### Options:

1. **Keep compatibility** - Add a submissions view/table that maps to deals/contacts
2. **Update everything** - Change all references from submissions to deals/contacts
3. **Dual support** - Support both old submissions and new deals/contacts

### Current State:

- Migration script: ✅ Fixed to use deals/contacts
- TypeScript types: ✅ Updated to use dealId/contactId
- UI Components: ❌ Still reference submissions/leadId

### Next Steps:

Before applying the migration, decide on the approach:

1. If you have a submissions table/view, the current code might work
2. If not, we need to update ActivityModal and other components to use deals/contacts
3. Consider creating a compatibility layer

## Files That May Need Updates:

- `/src/components/weekly-program/ActivityModal.tsx` - Uses submissions for lead selection
- `/src/hooks/useSubmissions.ts` - May need to fetch deals/contacts instead
- Any other components that link activities to leads/deals
