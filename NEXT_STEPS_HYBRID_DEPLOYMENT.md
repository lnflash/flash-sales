# Next Steps: Hybrid Program of Work Deployment

## Current Status âœ…
- All code implementation completed
- Database migration scripts fixed and ready
- Test scripts and documentation prepared
- All changes pushed to GitHub

## Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Apply Database Migrations
```bash
# Run this command with your database password
supabase db push
```

When prompted, enter your Supabase database password.

### 2. Verify Migration Success
Check your Supabase dashboard to confirm these tables were created:
- `program_activities`
- `program_weekly_goals`
- `program_custom_activity_types`
- `program_sync_status`
- `program_offline_queue`

### 3. Test the Implementation
Run the test script:
```bash
./test-hybrid-program-of-work.sh
```

Or follow the detailed checklist:
- `HYBRID_TESTING_CHECKLIST.md`

## What's Working Now

## Key Files Changed

### Migration Files
- `/supabase/migrations/20240803_program_of_work_tables.sql` - Main hybrid storage tables
- `/supabase/migrations/20240108_performance_indexes.sql` - Updated for defensive column checking

### Core Implementation
- `/src/services/program-sync.ts` - Sync service
- `/src/stores/useWeeklyProgramStore.ts` - Updated store with sync
- `/src/hooks/useAllRepsProgram.tsx` - Admin data fetching
- `/src/components/weekly-program/SyncStatusIndicator.tsx` - UI indicator

### CRM Integration
- `/src/components/weekly-program/EntitySelector.tsx` - Unified entity picker
- `/src/lib/supabase-crm-api.ts` - CRM data fetching

## Troubleshooting

### If migrations fail:
1. Check the error message
2. Verify your database credentials
3. Ensure you're on the correct Supabase branch

### If sync doesn't work:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify user is authenticated
3. Check network connection
4. Look at sync status indicator for errors

### If admin can't see data:
1. Verify user role is 'Flash Management' or 'Flash Admin'
2. Check RLS policies in Supabase
3. Ensure reps have synced their data

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Can create activities offline
- [ ] Activities sync when online
- [ ] Admin can see all reps' data
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Performance is good
